# Advanced-VQA-Model-with-FasterRCNN-and-LSTM
This repository contains the implementation of a state-of-the-art Visual Question Answering (VQA) model that utilizes a unique combination of a Bottom-Up approach with modified Faster R-CNN weights and a Top-Down approach using an attention-based LSTM model. The model has demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving a VQA score of 0.7.
